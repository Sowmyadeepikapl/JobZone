## ‚öôÔ∏è Component Breakdown

### 1. **React Frontend**

* Collects user inputs (name, email, skills, location)
* Sends POST request to API Gateway
* Renders job listings returned from the backend
* Has neon-themed dark mode toggle

### 2. **Amazon API Gateway**

* Acts as the entry point to your backend
* Connects HTTP requests to Lambda function
* Stage created: `/jobzone`
* CORS configured to allow `http://localhost:3000`

### 3. **AWS Lambda**

* Backend logic written in Python
* Parses input, formats query to JSearch API
* Stores response data in DynamoDB
* Handles CORS headers dynamically

### 4. **JSearch API (via RapidAPI)**

* External job search API
* Requires API key (stored as environment variable)
* Responds with job listings based on keyword + location

### 5. **DynamoDB**

* NoSQL table used to store:

  * User info (name, email)
  * Search details (keywords, location, timestamp)
  * Job listing results (title, company, etc.)

---

## üîê Security & Access

* **IAM Role** grants Lambda access to DynamoDB
* **Environment Variables** securely store secrets like API keys
* CORS properly enforced on both API Gateway & Lambda

---

## üõ†Ô∏è DevOps Additions (Planned)

* Add CI/CD with AWS CodePipeline
* Monitor Lambda logs using CloudWatch
* Terraform/IaC setup for auto-deployment

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

The JobZone architecture follows a clean serverless pattern with clear boundaries:
Frontend ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Lambda ‚Üí (External API + DB). This setup allows fast, cost-efficient, and scalable deployment using modern DevOps practices.
